# Pod Request Access Landing Page

## The Challenge

As part of a series of challenges on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), I had to build out an early access landing page (for a fictional website called Pod) and get it looking as close to the mock-up design as possible.

## Requirements

- View the optimal layout
  depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"

## Design
